            <p>
              WunPub is provided on an "as is" basis. We disclaim all warranties to
              the extent permitted by law. Our liability is limited to the amount
              you paid for the service in the 12 months preceding the claim. Some
              jurisdictions do not allow certain disclaimers or limitations, so they
              may not apply to you.

              changes, we will provide notice within the product or via email. Your
              continued use of WunPub after the effective date constitutes
              acceptance of the updated terms.
